 StockSense AI  
### AI-Powered Inventory Demand Forecasting System

StockSense AI is an intelligent inventory demand forecasting system that uses machine learning to help businesses predict future product demand, reduce stockouts, optimize inventory levels, and make smarter data-driven decisions.

This project was built as part of the **Afritech 30-Day AI Challenge**, demonstrating practical AI product development skills across research, design, modeling, and deployment.

Features

 **AI Demand Forecasting**  
  Predict future product demand using machine learning models.

   **Trend & Seasonality Analysis**  
  Identify recurring demand patterns and business cycles.

   **Data Diagnostics**  
  Automatically identify missing values, anomalies, and outliers.

   **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  Includes notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML training.

   **Interactive Web App (Streamlit/Gradio)**  
  Upload datasets, view forecasts, explore trend charts, download predictions.

  **Exportable Reports**  
  Generate downloadable forecast reports in CSV/PDF.

   **Modular Code Design**  
  Clean, production-ready folder structure for easy scale and collaboration.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stocksense-ai.git
cd stocksense-ai

##  Project Structure
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the App
To launch the interactive forecasting web app:
streamlit run app/app.py
streamlit run app/app.py
How It Works

Upload a CSV dataset (date + quantity sold).

The app cleans and preprocesses the data.

Model predicts future demand (daily/weekly/monthly).

User views:

Forecast chart

Trend + seasonality

Error metrics

Predictions can be downloaded as CSV or PDF.
